## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

Project initiation was completed using Create-React-App. From here I broke down the UI design into it's logical components. While thinking through the components, I had to figure out
how I was going to maintain various items' state. After the simple functionality, I worked on styling: from colors, to responsiveness, to spacing. I developed
using a mobile-first approach to ensure reponsiveness throughout all screen sizes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
